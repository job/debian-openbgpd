This is a port of OpenBGPD to other operating systems. It is based on
portability code from the OpenNTPD, OpenSSH, and LibreSSL portable projects.

OpenBGPD has a web site at http://openbgpd.com/

Platform Requirements
---------------------

At the time of writing the Portable version is known to build and work on:

 - OpenBSD-current
 - OpenBSD (6.5)
 - Linux (Debian 9)
 - FreeBSD (12.x)

OpenBGPD may work on other operating systems, newer and older, but the above
ones are tested regularly by the developer.
